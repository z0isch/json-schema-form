This is a web component that can take a json schema document and produce an html form that can create valid json for the spec.

This should be a web component that can be used like `<json-schema-form schema="JSON Schema as a string" onSubmit=fn></json-schema-form>`

This project should use `lit` (https://lit.dev/) to make the web component and the project should be written in TypeScipt

The json schema spec is located at json-schema-spec.txt, and this library should support all features of a json schema.
